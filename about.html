        <p>I am Hridunand M, a passionate computer science student currently pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Amritapuri. I have a keen interest in coding, problem-solving, and building meaningful tech projects.</p>

        <p>I completed my SSLC from G.G.V.H.S.S., Feroke, and my Plus Two from St. Joseph's Boys H.S.S., Calicut. During my 10th grade, I was an active member of the Atal Tinkering Lab (ATL), where I participated in innovative tech activities and hands-on projects, which sparked my interest in engineering and technology early on.</p>

        <p>I’m originally from Beypore, Kozhikode, Kerala, India—a beautiful coastal town known for its shipbuilding legacy and rich culture.</p>

        <p>In my free time, I enjoy listening to music, reading books, and diving into coding projects that challenge and inspire me.</p>
